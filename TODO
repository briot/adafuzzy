* If multiple rule have an output on same term ("power is full"), can
  we combine them before we do the accumulation ? This could save time,
  and allow us to display the fuzzy value of an output:

      power = 0/LOW + 0.282/MEDIUM + 0.218/HIGH
      power.output = 64.354

* OK Test performance against other libraries
   100_000 iteration of simple temperature/power controller:
      Ada:       0m0.660s
      fuzzylite: 0m1.266s
      ffll:      ???

* Lookup tables for memberships, especially for centroids
* faster centroid for predefined membership forms
* visitors (for debug, GUI, ...)
* Generate code (no need for malloc for instance)
* Make it work with singleton membership
  fcl uses a special COGS defuzzify function for this
* Allow Hedge for output variables in rules
* Rules should either all OR or all AND for their antecedents
* FCL
  - extension to allow hedges
  - Support for OR expressions when parsing fcl
